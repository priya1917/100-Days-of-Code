Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ²

Welcome to Day 12 of my #100DaysOfCode Challenge! Today's project is a Number Guessing Game implemented in Python, combining randomness, logic, and user interactivity to create a fun and engaging experience.

About the Project
The Number Guessing Game challenges players to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 100 within a limited number of attempts. Players can select their preferred difficulty level, which determines the number of available attempts.

Features
Randomized Target Number: The program uses Pythonâ€™s randint() to select a random number between 1 and 100.
Difficulty Levels:
Easy Mode: Players have 10 attempts to guess the number.
Hard Mode: Players have 5 attempts to guess the number.
User Feedback: The program provides hints if the guess is too high or too low to guide players toward the correct answer.
Attempts Tracking: Displays the remaining attempts after each guess and ends the game when attempts run out.
Replayability: The game resets for a new round once the correct number is guessed or attempts are exhausted.

Key Learnings
Conditional Logic: Reinforced skills in using if-elif-else statements for decision-making.
Loops and Iteration: Used while loops to implement repeated guessing functionality.
Function Design: Created modular functions for reusability and readability:
check_answer() for validating guesses.
set_difficulty() for managing difficulty settings.
User Interaction: Designed prompts and feedback to guide players and enhance engagement.
Why This Project?
This project was a fun way to apply loops, conditionals, and randomization in Python while creating a dynamic and user-friendly experience. It emphasizes problem-solving and user interaction, making it a valuable exercise in both programming and design thinking.

Stay tuned for more projects as I continue my #100DaysOfCode Challenge! ðŸš€

Feel free to try the game and share your feedback. Letâ€™s keep learning and building together! ðŸŽ¯
