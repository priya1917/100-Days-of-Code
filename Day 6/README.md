Day 6 of #100DaysOfCode: Robot Maze Solver ðŸ¤–

Today, I worked on an intriguing challengeâ€”programming a robot to navigate and solve a maze using Python! In this project, the robot starts at a random position within the maze and successfully finds its way out using logical steps and loops.

Skills Practiced:
âœ… Loops: Implemented while loops to guide the robot through the maze until it reaches the exit.
âœ… Conditional Logic: Used if-elif statements to determine when the robot should move forward, turn left, or turn right based on its surroundings.
âœ… Dynamic Problem-Solving: Accounted for the robot's random starting position, ensuring the code adapts to different scenarios.
âœ… Debugging and Optimization: Enhanced efficiency by refining the logic to handle edge cases and optimize movement.

Reflections:
This project emphasized the power of loops and logic in solving dynamic problems. Watching the robot navigate from a random position and consistently find its way out was incredibly rewarding! It reinforced my understanding of structured programming and problem-solving in unpredictable environments.

You can give it a try here: Reeborgâ€™s World Maze (https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json)

On to Day 7 with even more enthusiasm! ðŸš€
