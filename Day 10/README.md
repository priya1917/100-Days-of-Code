Calculator Program ðŸ§®
Welcome to Day 10 of my #100DaysOfCode Challenge! Todayâ€™s project is a dynamic calculator program implemented in Python. This project combines mathematical operations, interactive user input, and modular programming to create a functional and user-friendly tool.

About the Project
The Calculator Program allows users to perform basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It features a dynamic flow where users can continue calculations with the current result or start fresh, making it both flexible and intuitive.

Features
Core Operations: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Dynamic Flow:
Continue calculations with the current result.
Option to start a new calculation at any time.
Interactive UI: User-friendly prompts for selecting operations and entering numbers.
Reusable Design: Uses a dictionary of operations to keep the code modular and scalable.

Follow the prompts:
Enter the first number.
Choose an operation (e.g., +, -, *, /).
Enter the second number.
Decide whether to continue with the current result or start a new calculation.

Key Learnings
Functions as First-Class Objects: Leveraged Pythonâ€™s ability to store functions in a dictionary for dynamic operation selection.
Modular Programming: Encapsulated logic for operations and program flow into functions for better readability and scalability.
Interactive User Experience: Designed a loop to allow continuous calculations without restarting the program.
Recursion: Used recursion to restart the program for new calculations, ensuring a seamless user experience.
Why This Project?
This project reinforced foundational programming concepts like functions, dictionaries, loops, and recursion. It was a great reminder of how combining simplicity with thoughtful design can create a flexible and user-friendly tool.
