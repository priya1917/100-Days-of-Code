Higher or Lower Game ðŸŽ²
Welcome to Day 14 of my #100DaysOfCode Challenge! Todayâ€™s project is a Higher or Lower Game implemented in Python. This interactive game tests your instincts by challenging you to guess which of two accounts has more followers.

About the Project
The Higher or Lower Game presents two random accounts along with their details (name, description, and country). The player must decide which account has a higher follower count. The game continues until an incorrect guess is made, with the playerâ€™s score being tracked throughout.

Features
Randomized Comparisons: The game selects accounts randomly from a pre-defined dataset to ensure variety.
Follower Comparison Logic: Accurately compares follower counts to determine the correct choice.
Dynamic Feedback: Updates the playerâ€™s score and game state after each round.

Key Learnings
Data Manipulation: Worked with structured datasets using dictionaries to manage account information.
Randomization: Used Pythonâ€™s random.choice() for dynamic selection of accounts.
Logic Building: Designed a robust comparison system to evaluate follower counts and determine game outcomes.
Function Design: Developed modular functions to format data and handle game logic, improving code clarity and scalability.

Why This Project?
This project provided a great opportunity to practice data handling, modular programming, and dynamic user interaction. It emphasized the importance of writing clean, reusable code while creating an engaging experience for the player.
