Blind Auction Program ðŸŽ¯

Welcome to Day 9 of my #100DaysOfCode Challenge! Today's project is a Blind Auction Program implemented in Python. This interactive program simulates a blind auction where multiple bidders can place bids, and the highest bidder is determined.

About the Project
The Blind Auction Program allows multiple users to participate in an auction by entering their names and bid amounts. Once all bids are collected, the program identifies the highest bidder. It ensures fair participation by clearing the screen after each bidder, simulating a blind auction experience.

Features
Bid Recording: Collects the name and bid amount from each participant.
Blind Auction Simulation: Clears the screen after each bidderâ€™s input to maintain confidentiality.
Highest Bidder Determination: Automatically calculates and displays the winner with the highest bid.
Interactive Flow: Allows for multiple participants and terminates only when no additional bidders remain.

Follow the prompts:
Enter your name and bid amount.
Decide if there are more bidders or end the auction.
View the winner and the highest bid after the auction concludes!

Key Learnings
Dictionary Manipulation: Gained hands-on experience with updating and iterating through dictionaries.
Loop Control: Used while loops for dynamic user interaction and flexible program flow.
Function Design: Created modular functions like find_highest_bidder to separate logic and improve code readability.
User Interaction: Built a user-friendly interface with clear prompts and seamless handling of multiple participants.

Why This Project?
This project was an excellent opportunity to apply data structures like dictionaries and practice control flow in Python. It reinforced key programming concepts like input handling, modular design, and dynamic iteration.

Stay tuned for more projects as I continue my #100DaysOfCode Challenge! ðŸš€

Feel free to try out the program and share your feedback. Letâ€™s keep building and learning together! ðŸŽ¯
