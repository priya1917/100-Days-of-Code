Hangman Game ðŸŽ®
Welcome to Day 7 of my #100DaysOfCode Challenge! Todayâ€™s project is the classic Hangman Game, implemented in Python. This interactive game lets players guess letters to uncover a hidden word while avoiding "game over" by running out of lives.

About the Game

Hangman is a word-guessing game where the player tries to guess the word one letter at a time. Each wrong guess reduces the player's lives, and the game ends if they run out of chances. This project adds a creative touch by including ASCII art for the hangman stages and game logo.

Features

Word Randomization: A word is chosen randomly from a predefined word list.
Dynamic Feedback:
Displays progress with placeholders as the player guesses letters.
Alerts players if theyâ€™ve already guessed a letter.
Life Tracking: The player starts with 6 lives, and incorrect guesses reduce the count.
Game Stages: Includes ASCII art to visually represent the hangman stages for each incorrect guess.
Win/Loss Detection:
The game ends when the word is fully guessed or the player runs out of lives.
Displays the correct word if the player loses.

Follow the on-screen instructions:
Guess letters one at a time.
Avoid incorrect guesses to save lives.
Win by guessing the word before running out of lives!
Key Learnings
Modular Programming: Split the game logic into smaller, reusable components.
Randomization: Used the random module to select words dynamically.
Input Validation: Handled duplicate guesses and provided appropriate feedback.

Game States: Managed game flow, win/loss conditions, and dynamic updates for player feedback.
ASCII Art Integration: Enhanced user experience with visual hangman stages.
Why This Project?
The Hangman Game was a great way to combine loops, conditionals, and modular programming. It reinforced my understanding of user input handling, game logic, and code readability while adding a creative layer with ASCII art.

Stay tuned for more projects as I continue my #100DaysOfCode Challenge! ðŸš€

Feel free to try out the game and share your feedback. Letâ€™s keep learning and building! ðŸŽ¯
