Blackjack Game üÉè
Welcome to Day 12 of my #100DaysOfCode Challenge! Today‚Äôs project is a Blackjack Game implemented in Python. This program simulates the classic card game, allowing users to play against the computer while practicing decision-making and strategy.

About the Project
The Blackjack Game is a simplified version of the casino classic. The goal is to beat the computer by having a hand value closer to 21 without going over. The program features dynamic gameplay with randomized cards, decision-making options, and scoring logic.

Features
Card Dealing: Cards are dealt randomly from a deck using Python's random module.
Dynamic Scoring: Automatically calculates the hand value, accounting for Aces as either 1 or 11 based on the current score.
Player Decisions:
Choose to "hit" (draw another card) or "stand" (end your turn).
The computer follows Blackjack rules, drawing cards until its score is at least 17.
Win/Loss Scenarios: Built-in logic determines outcomes like:
Blackjack wins (score of 21 with two cards).
Going over 21 results in an automatic loss.
Closest score to 21 wins.
Replayability: Players can choose to replay the game as many times as they want.

Follow the prompts:
View your current hand and score.
Decide whether to draw another card or stand.
Watch as the computer plays its turn.
See the final scores and outcome of the game!

Key Learnings
List Manipulation: Used lists to manage the cards in each player‚Äôs hand.
Conditionals and Loops: Implemented logic to handle game flow and ensure adherence to Blackjack rules.
Randomization: Leveraged Python‚Äôs random.choice() to simulate card dealing.
Function Design: Encapsulated key game features like scoring, card dealing, and outcome comparison into reusable functions.
Game Flow Management: Built a seamless loop to enable multiple rounds of gameplay.

Why This Project?
This project was a great exercise in combining logic, interactivity, and randomness to create an engaging game. It reinforced concepts like list manipulation, modular programming, and conditional logic, while also highlighting how small features like score calculation and decision-making can add depth to a project.

Stay tuned for more projects as I continue my #100DaysOfCode Challenge! üöÄ

Feel free to try the game and share your feedback. Let‚Äôs keep learning and building together! üéØ
