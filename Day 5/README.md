##Password Generator ðŸ”’
Welcome to the Password Generator, a simple yet powerful tool to create secure, random passwords. This project is part of my Day 5 contribution to the #100DaysOfCode Challenge. It demonstrates the importance of cybersecurity and the practical application of programming in solving real-world problems.

##About the Project
The Password Generator is a Python-based program that lets users create custom, strong passwords. By specifying the number of letters, symbols, and numbers, users can generate secure passwords tailored to their needs.

##Features
Customizable Passwords: Specify the number of letters, symbols, and numbers.
Randomized Security: Utilizes the random module for unpredictable password generation.
Dynamic Shuffling: Ensures password randomness by shuffling the characters.
Simple Interface: User-friendly prompts for quick and easy password creation.

##How to Use
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Password-Generator.git
cd Password-Generator

##Run the script:
python password_generator.py

Follow the prompts to enter:
Number of letters
Number of symbols
Number of numbers
Get your secure, randomized password!

##Key Learnings
Randomization: Leveraged the random module for robust password creation.
List Manipulation: Created and shuffled lists to ensure high-level randomness.
User Input Handling: Enhanced interactivity by dynamically tailoring passwords based on user needs.
String Construction: Improved techniques for combining and formatting character sequences.

##Why This Project?
Strong passwords are essential in todayâ€™s digital landscape. This project is a step toward understanding and implementing cybersecurity best practices. It highlights how even small tools can have a meaningful impact on everyday security.
