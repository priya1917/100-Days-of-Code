##Rock-Paper-Scissors Game ✂️🪨📄
Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors Game, a fun and interactive project built in Python as part of my Day 4 of the #100DaysOfCode Challenge. This game lets you relive the classic childhood favorite while exploring basic programming concepts.

##About the Game
This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Players compete against the computer, which makes its choice randomly. Your goal? Outsmart the computer by picking the winning move!

##Features
Choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
Randomized computer choices for an unpredictable game experience.
Visual representation using ASCII art for added fun.
Handles invalid inputs gracefully, ensuring a seamless user experience.

##How to Play
Clone the repository:

##Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Rock-Paper-Scissors.git
cd Rock-Paper-Scissors
Run the script:
python rps_game.py

Follow the prompt to make your choice:
Type 0 for Rock
Type 1 for Paper
Type 2 for Scissors
Watch the outcome and see if you can beat the computer!

##Key Learnings
Reinforced the use of conditional statements for decision-making.
Explored the random module to generate unpredictable outcomes.
Improved input validation techniques to handle edge cases.
Enhanced the game’s appeal with creative ASCII art representations.
Why This Project?
This project may seem simple, but it is a great exercise to strengthen fundamental programming skills while building something engaging. It demonstrates how to merge logic with creativity to create user-friendly applications.

Stay tuned for more projects as I continue my #100DaysOfCode Challenge! 🚀

Feel free to try the game and share your feedback. Let’s have some fun while learning! 🎮
