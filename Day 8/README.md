Caesar Cipher üîê

Welcome to Day 8 of my #100DaysOfCode Challenge! Today‚Äôs project is the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique that shifts the letters of a message by a specified amount to encode or decode it.

About the Project
The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest encryption methods. This Python implementation allows users to encode and decode messages by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a user-defined number of positions. The project includes functionality to handle special characters and wraps around the alphabet seamlessly.

Features
Encrypt Messages: Convert plain text into a coded message by shifting the letters.
Decrypt Messages: Decode a message back into its original form by reversing the shift.
Handle Special Characters: Leaves non-alphabet characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) unchanged.
Interactive UI: User-friendly prompts for input and an option to restart or exit the program.

How to Use
Follow the prompts:
Type encode to encrypt a message or decode to decrypt one.
Enter the message and the desired shift value.
View the encoded/decoded result!

Key Learnings
String Manipulation: Practiced efficient ways to process and transform strings in Python.
Modular Design: Created reusable functions to handle the encoding and decoding logic.
Edge Case Handling: Ensured functionality for special characters and large shift values using modular arithmetic.
User Interaction: Built a simple loop to allow users to encode/decode multiple messages in one session.

Why This Project?
The Caesar Cipher project was a great opportunity to revisit foundational concepts like loops, conditionals, and indexing. It‚Äôs a simple yet practical demonstration of how basic programming can implement real-world techniques like encryption.
